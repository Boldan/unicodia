Matrix for modifier chars is: W×65%, H×60% starting from char origin, and Y+407; old chars Y+120.
Matrix for subscript chars is: W×65%, H×60% starting from char origin, and Y−96.


=== Toto • unknown origin ===

Probably someone from SIL International, SIL Open Font License
Probably fully working, I tried to copy all tables

Diaeresis works, numbers do not
Matrix is ×135%


=== Coptic • NewAthena  ===

Functionality is mine from scratch, at least as working as Noto!


=== Makasar • MakasarGraphite  ===

Functionality is mine from scratch, at OpenType instead of Graphite


== Status of MY scripts ==

Cypro-Minoan: should work
Nag: working
Garay: barely working, either improve or hand to other font


== Stability policy ==

Lone characters WILL eventually disappear
Super/subscripts — IDK, while Unicodia’s main font is Cambria, won’t
Working scripts will disappear only together with handing over to better font
* Ottoman Siyaq → use Noto
