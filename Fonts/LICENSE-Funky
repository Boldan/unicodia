You just DO WHAT THE FUNK YOU WANT TO

Except some glyphs:

== © Google Noto, SIL Open Font License ==

All characters of Latin, Cyrillic and Balinese; Japanese and Korean umlauts
(Matrix for modifier chars is: W×65%, H×60% starting from char origin, and Y+407; old chars Y+120.
Matrix for subscript chars is: W×65%, H×60% starting from char origin, and Y−96.)


== Unknown origin (probably someone from SIL International), SIL Open Font License ==

Toto script, 1E290…1E2AF
(probably fully working, I tried to copy all tables)


== Junicode © Peter Baker, SIL Open Font License ==

Gothic script, 10330…4A
(Diaeresis works, numbers do not)
(Matrix is ×135%)


== NewAthena © Society for Classical Studies, SIL Open Font License ==

Coptic script. A bit incomplete, but at least more functional than NewAthena!


== Status of MY scripts ==
Cypro-Minoan: probably working
Nag: working, but there are no Latin etc in Funky
