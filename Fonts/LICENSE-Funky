== Stability policy ==

WILL STAY:
* Working scripts of decent quality made by me: Makasar, Cypro-Minoan, Nag, Todhri
* ASCII and other auxiliary characters
* All of them MAY change style/metrics

WILL PROBABLY DISAPPEAR when better font arrives:
* Scripts made by others
* Super/subscripts: while Unicodia’s main font is Cambria, won’t

WILL SURELY DISAPPEAR:
* Lone characters made to gag tofu
* All non-functional scripts, both mine and others’
* All craggy scripts, both mine and others’

ALREADY DISAPPEARED and handing to other fonts
* Ottoman Siyaq numbers → use Noto Ottoman Siyaq
* Devanagari Jain symbols → use Noto Devanagari
