== Stability policy ==

Lone characters WILL eventually disappear
* Devanagari Jain symbols → use Noto

ASCII and other auxiliary characters WILL NOT disapear

Super/subscripts — IDK, while Unicodia’s main font is Cambria, won’t

Working scripts will disappear only together with handing over to better font
* Ottoman Siyaq → use Noto
